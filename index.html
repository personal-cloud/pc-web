  <h3>Reclaiming Personal Computing in the Cloud</h3>

  <p>Early computing infrastructure began as centralized systems - mainframes - in order to make best of use of hardware and cost constraints.</p>

  <p>Over time these centralized systems gave way to distributed ownership - personal computers - when these initial constraints were overcome. This has led to an explosion in new applications.</p>

  <p>Internet services and cloud computing has reached such an inflection point. The constraints that once required centralized systems to operate at Internet-scale have been overcome.</p>

  <p><b>Welcome to the era of the Personal Cloud.</b></p>
