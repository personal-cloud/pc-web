  <h1>Personal Cloud</h1>
  <h3>Reclaiming Personal Computing in the Cloud</h3>

  <p>Historically computing infrastructure began as centralized systems - mainframes - in order to make best of use of hardware and cost constraints.</p>

  <p>Over time these centralized systems gave way to distributed ownership - personal computing - when these initial cost constraints were overcome. This has led to an explosion in new applications and services.</p>

  <p>Internet services and cloud computing has reached such an inflection point.</p>

  <p>The constraints that once required centralized systems to operate at Internet-scale have been overcome. We can now build applications and services which scale automatically to any need, at a price point that allows for <i>personal ownership</i>.</p>

  <p>Welcome to the era of the Personal Cloud.</p>
