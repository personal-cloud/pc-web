# Introducing Cloud Apps

Cloud Apps are like the apps on your phone, except they run in your personal cloud. Let's look at some of the differences and similarities compared to mobile apps you're already familiar with.

### Similarities to Mobile Apps

- **Automatic Upgrades**: Like apps on your phone cloud apps are updated by the developer in the background automatically, so you always have the latest features and security fixes.

- **Data storage**: Whereas mobile apps store data and files on the phone itself, cloud apps store and access data on your personal cloud, where access is strictly controlled.

- **Automatic Backups**: Like your phone, your personal cloud stores your most important data - so data is periodically backed up automatically.

- **Resource efficient**: Cloud apps like mobile apps are not running all the time - they are suspended when not in use to conserve resources and reactivated when needed.

- **Pricing and In-App Purchasing**: Cloud apps can be free or have pricing chosen by the developer. Developers can use in-app purchasing to enable certain features or experiences, similar to mobile apps.

- **App Store**: Finding new cloud apps via the app store is easy. Cloud apps can be installed to your personal cloud with one click, and up and running instantly.

### What Makes Cloud Apps Unique

- **Web Accessible**: Cloud apps in your personal cloud exist on the Internet, and are accessed via a unique web address (secured over TLS). Depending on the app configuration, access may be limited or allow access by anyone.

- **Tech Agnostic**: Cloud apps are based on container technology that allows them to be written in any programming language.

- **Run at the Edge**: Cloud apps are run in datacenters close to the end user for the best interactive experience.

- **Data Interop**: Because you own the data stored in your personal cloud, cloud apps can request access your data to create new experiences - similar to opening the same file in two different mobile apps.

Hopefully this lays out a little of the exciting new world of cloud apps.
