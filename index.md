# Personal Cloud

### Reclaiming Personal Computing in the Cloud

Early computing infrastructure began with centralized ownership - mainframes - in order to make best of use of hardware and cost constraints.

Over time centralization gave way to distributed ownership - personal computers - when these initial constraints were overcome. This has led to an explosion in new applications.

Cloud computing has reached such an inflection point. The constraints that once required centrally owned services to operate at Internet-scale have been overcome.

The next step is distributed ownership over Internet services and their data.
