# Personal Cloud

### Reclaiming Personal Computing in the Cloud

Early computing infrastructure began as centralized systems - mainframes - in order to make best of use of hardware and cost constraints.

Over time these centralized systems gave way to distributed ownership - personal computers - when these initial constraints were overcome. This has led to an explosion in new applications.

Internet services and cloud computing has reached such an inflection point. The constraints that once required centralized systems to operate at Internet-scale have been overcome.
